This section presents the results obtained from the different versions of the model after having trained with the procedure described in \autoref{sec:methodologies-experiments}.
From the results, it was found that all three versions of the model were capable of following the trends of the disease when applied to the considered locations, except for Ho Chi Minh city and Vietnam.
Moreover, the comparative analysis between the different versions revealed that the model's performance on out-of-sample data did not improve when the chosen covariates were included to inform the model.
