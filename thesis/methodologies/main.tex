In this thesis, we focused on finding an interpretable disease model for Covid-19 in Vietnam.
The model was expected to have the ability to capture the complex dynamics of the disease from data at an early stage, which can help inform people about a potential outbreak of the disease.
We utilized \glspl{UDE} which add neural network on top of classical compartmental models for infectious diseases to formulate the model.
Because it had been shown that multiple different factors have different effects on the dynamics of the disease, we encoded different covariates into the model to improve the predictive performance \cite{ihmecovid-19forecastingteamModelingCOVID19Scenarios2021,arikInterpretableSequenceLearning,}.
Several experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of adding different covariates to inform the model.
In this section, we will outline the model formulations, the experiments that were conducted, and how the models were evaluated.
