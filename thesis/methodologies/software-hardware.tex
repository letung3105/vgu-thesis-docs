\section{Software and hardware}

The scripts for generating the datasets described in \autoref{sec:methodologies-data}, the models defined in \autoref{sec:methodologies-models-definitions} and the training algorithm defined in \autoref{sec:methodologies-parameters-estimation} were implemented using the Julia programming language \cite{bezanson2012julia}.
The implementation was written as a Julia package and was tested with Julia version 1.7.0.
Julia was chosen for the implementation because of the strongly supported packages for solving differential equations and computing the gradients of those equations.
The two main packages that were utilized are the \textit{DifferentialEquations} package \cite{rackauckas2017differentialequations} for solving the system of \glspl{ODE} defined by \autoref{eq:methodologies-seir-ude-model} and the \textit{DiffEqFlux} \cite{rackauckasUniversalDifferentialEquations2020} package for computing the gradients and estimating the system's parameters.

The experiments were conducted on two different hardware configurations.
The first that was used for testing the models was the cloud compute instance provided by Google Cloud \footnote{\url{https://cloud.google.com/compute}}.
The system ran on the Ubuntu 20.04 operating system and was configured using the \textit{n2-standard-8} machine type provided by Google \footnote{\url{https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/compute-optimized-machines}}.
The second hardware system was a laptop running on the Manjaro operating system with Linux kernel version \textit{5.10.70-1-MANJARO} and included a 2-core \textit{Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4260U} CPU with each core running at 1.40GHz, and the system has 4Gb of memory.
While the models were expected to run on any operating system that was supported by Julia, it was not tested on any other operating system besides Linux.
Thus the model might not work as expected when running on a different operating system.
Although the model had been tested and shown that it could run on a resource-limited system with only 4Gb memory, using a system with higher memory is recommended if the script is running along with other processes.
Because the Julia programming language utilizes \gls{JIT} compilation on the first time a block of code is run to create optimized native code, the initial startup of the package can consume lots of hardware resources and crashes if there is not enough memory for the \gls{JIT} compilation process.
After the initial startup process is completed, the training process and evaluation process do not require as much hardware resource.

\subsection{Package overview}

The core of the package is the function that implements the system of \glspl{ODE} given by \autoref{eq:methodologies-seir-model}.
With Julia and the \textit{DifferentialEquations} \footnote{\url{https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl}} package, \autoref{eq:methodologies-seir-model} can be implemented as a simple function given by \autoref{fig:diffeq-seird-inplace}.
Using the function shown in \autoref{fig:diffeq-seird-inplace}, proxy functions on top of it can be implemented to make changes to the values of the parameters before using them to compute the derivatives.
Several structs are defined to help to create these proxies for the different versions of the model, and their general structure is illustrated in \autoref{fig:diffeq-seird-fb2-struct}.
By utilizing the Julia feature that allows us to make an object of a struct callable like any function, a proxy function around the function shown in \autoref{fig:diffeq-seird-inplace} can be created that makes use of the data held by the struct in \autoref{fig:diffeq-seird-fb2-struct}.
The definition of such proxy function is shown in \autoref{fig:diffeq-seird-fb2}.
To solve the system of \gls{ODE} given by the function in \autoref{fig:diffeq-seird-fb2}, the function \textit{solve} together with the type \textit{ODEProblem} from the \textit{DifferentialEquations} package are used.
The general usage of the function is given by \autoref{fig:diffeq-solve-usage}.
Because the \textit{solve} function has several arguments that can be chosen, a callable struct is defined to hold these arguments and provide an object that can be invoked with the minimal number of arguments.
The definition of this struct is given by \autoref{fig:diffeq-seird-predictor}.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{jllisting}
model = SEIRDFbMobility2( /* ... */ )
u0 = [ /* ... */ ]
tspan = (0, 47)
tsteps = tspan[1]:1:tspan[2]
problem = ODEProblem(model, u0, tspan)
solution = solve(problem, Tsit5(), saveat=tsteps)
\end{jllisting}
\caption[Solving system of ODEs with \textit{DifferentialEquations} package in Julia]{A simple usage of the \textit{solve} function from the \textit{DifferentialEquations} package. Here we are solving the system of ODEs on the time span from $0$ to $47$ and save the system state at an interval of $1$ time step. \textit{model} is an object of the struct \textit{SEIRDFbMobility2} shown in \autoref{fig:diffeq-seird-fb2-struct}, \textit{u0} is the system initial state, \textit{tspan} is the modeled period, and \textit{tsteps} is the time steps where the system state will be saved for output stored by \textit{solution}. Additionally, the first argument to the constructor of the type \textit{ODEProblem} could take any callable object that can be invoked with the arguments \textit{(du,u,p,t)}, where \textit{du} is a vector that will be modified in-place to contain the system derivatives at each time step, \textit{u} is a vector contains the current state of the system, \textit{p} is a vector contains all the system parameters, and \textit{t} is the value of the current time step.}.

\end{figure}

The package utilizes the function \textit{sciml\_train} from the \textit{DiffEqFlux} \footnote{\url{https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqFlux.jl}} package to train the model.
This function defines all the necessary steps for estimating the set of parameters that minimizes an arbitrary loss function using a specific optimizer.
The general usage of the function is illustrated by \autoref{fig:diffeq-sciml-train}.
Because the \textit{sciml\_train} function only works with loss functions that accept the system parameters as the only argument, we define a callable struct that contains all the other data that is required when calculating the loss in addition to the system parameters.
\autoref{fig:diffeq-seird-loss} shows the definition of this helper struct.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{jllisting}
function loss(params)
    /* ... */
end
params = [ /* ... */ ]
opt = ADAM(lr=0.01)
res = DiffEqFlux.sciml_train(loss, params, opt; maxiters=500)
\end{jllisting}
\caption[Training UDE with \textit{DiffEqFlux} package in Julia]{A simple usage of the \textit{sciml\_train} function from the \textit{DiffEqFlux} package. Here, we are finding the set of parameters that can minimize the loss function defined by \textit{loss}, which takes a set of parameters and returns a scalar loss value calculated using the given parameters. Furthermore, in this example, the ADAM optimizer is used for 500 iterations, and the variable \textit{params} holds that initial set of parameters.}

Most of the core functions and structs in this package are parametric over its parameters or fields to allow for a wide range of data types that can be used with them while not sacrificing performance.
Using parametric type helps to create \textit{type-stable} functions where the type of any variables used by a function is known at compile time.
As a result, Julia will produce more performance native code as there is no runtime type checking and no heap allocation caused by polymorphic variables.

Besides the core functionalities described above, the developed package also contains structs for representing time series data and functions for data collecting and preprocessing.
Functions that collect and process the datasets used in the experiments of the thesis are grouped into modules based on where the datasets originated from.
The module \textit{FacebookData} contains functions for extracting data from the \glspl{MRM} dataset and the \gls{SCI} dataset.
Moreover, this module also contains the function for calculating the \gls{SPC} index from the \gls{SCI} index.
The module \textit{JHUCSSEData} contains functions for extracting Covid-19 cases data and for getting \gls{US} counties population from the datasets from the \gls{JHU}.
The module \textit{PopulationData} contains functions for combining Vietnam's population data from the \gls{GSO} with the administrative levels data from the \gls{GADM}.
The module \textit{VnExpressData} contains functions for downloading Covid-19 data from VnExpress \footnote{\url{https://vnexpress.net}} and the module \textit{VnCdcData} contains functions for parsing the data from \gls{VNCDC} \footnote{\url{https://ncov.vncdc.gov.vn}}.
All the data collecting and processing modules depended on the package \textit{DataDeps} \footnote{\url{https://github.com/oxinabox/DataDeps.jl}} for managing data dependencies.
The \textit{DataDeps} package simplified the process of downloading static files from servers into a local machine and provided the program the paths to all the downloaded files.

Finally, using the package, several experiments are set up based on the configurations given in \autoref{sec:methodologies-experiments}, and the functions for setting up these experiments are included along with the package.
The implementation the loss function defined by \autoref{eq:ude-model-loss} is included among these functions, and its definition is shown in \autoref{fig:diffeq-seird-experiment-loss}.
Moreover, the experiments can be run in parallel when training with data for multiple different locations by using the threads that are available in the system.
For easy access to the training and evaluation of the experiments, the package \textit{ArgParse} \footnote{\url{https://github.com/carlobaldassi/ArgParse.jl}} is used to provide a command-line interface for running the experiments with predefined locations.
