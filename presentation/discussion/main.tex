\section{Discussion}

\begin{frame}{About the results}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Could capture the disease trends with high accuracy
        \item Accuracy get lower as we extrapolated further into the future
        \item Bad fit and low forecast accuracy when applied to data with high fluctuation
        \item No improvement in the forecast accuracy when mobility data was incorporated
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Model's convergence and generalizability}

\begin{frame}{Model's convergence and generalizability}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The model could get stuck in bad local minima, due to
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \glspl{ODE} \textit{stiffness}
            \item High frequency changes
        \end{itemize}
        \item The model was separately trained at each location and only capable of making forecast for the location that it was trained with
        \item Forecast can only be made for a short period after the training period
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Model's limitations}

\begin{frame}{Model's limitations}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Issues with ground truth data
        \item Inability to capture rapid trend changes
        \item Bad local minima
        \item Compartmental model bias
        \item Covariates bias
        \item Inability to capture real dynamics of the disease
        \item Neural network interpretability
    \end{itemize}
