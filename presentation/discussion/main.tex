\section{Discussion}

\begin{frame}{About the results}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<1-> Could capture the disease trends
        \item<2-> Accuracy get lower as we extrapolated further into the future
        \item<3-> Bad fit and low forecast accuracy when applied to data with high fluctuation
        \item<4-> No improvement in the forecast accuracy when mobility data was incorporated
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Model's convergence and generalizability}

\begin{frame}{Model's convergence and generalizability}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<1-> The model could get stuck in bad local minima, due to
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \glspl{ODE} \textit{stiffness}
            \item High frequency changes
        \end{itemize}
        \item<2-> The model was separately trained at each location and only capable of making forecast for the location that it was trained with
        \item<3-> Forecast can only be made for a short period after the training period
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Model's limitations}

\begin{frame}{Model's limitations}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<1-> Issues with ground truth data
        \item<2-> Inability to capture rapid trend changes
        \item<3-> Bad local minima
        \item<4-> Compartmental model bias
        \item<5-> Covariates bias
        \item<6-> The changing dynamics of Covid-19
        \item<7-> Neural network interpretability
    \end{itemize}
