\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{What has been done?}
    \textbf{Goals:} An explainable Covid-19 model that can work with the low data availability in Vietnam
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Collect and process Covid-19 related data for various locations
        \item Implement a model an explainable Covid-19 model using \gls{UDE}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Progression of all compartments can be given by the model
            \item Metric about the disease, e.g. $\mathcal{R}_0$, can be derived
        \end{itemize}
        \item Add mobility data to the model and show that ineffectiveness of the approach
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Future improvements}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Increase the model complexity with additional compartments and parameters
        \item Include additional time-varying covariates
        \item Implement better methods and algorithms for training \gls{UDE}
        \item Use methods such as \gls{SINDy} to find a governing equation and improve the model interpretability
    \end{itemize}
